I have finished my implementation plan and am working through the tasks. But I have been struggling with the flow of the program. Despite having my control flow diagram to look at, the implementation of how one method should lead onto another is troubling me. 

For example, when the new user creates a new noteboard, how should it link to my display_noteboard method(Via call in initialization or via main.rb)? Secondly I am having doubts about my arrangement of classes and methods. I currently a noteboard class and a notes class but since notes is just manipulations of noteboards, I am wondering to put everything under noteboard class. 

Lastly I am trying to follow TDD doctrine but it has been difficult. I understand what to test but I feel my knowledge of test writing in unit/test is insufficient.

I have made progress through my implementation plan. I have ticked off some of the tasks like ARGV arguments, add note, delete file. But core problems surround the manipulation of the current working file.I need to assign the newly created file and existing file to variable that the program can apply methods. I have been developing features but unable to piece it together without this lynchpin.
