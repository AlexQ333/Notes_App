I have finished my implementation plan and am working through the tasks. But I have been struggling with the flow of the program. Despite having my control flow diagram to look at, the implementation of how one method should lead onto another is troubling me. 

For example, when the new user creates a new noteboard, how should it link to my display_noteboard method(Via call in initialization or via main.rb)? Secondly I am having doubts about my arrangement of classes and methods. I currently a noteboard class and a notes class but since notes is just manipulations of noteboards, I am wondering to put everything under noteboard class. 

Lastly I am trying to follow TDD doctrine but it has been difficult. I understand what to test but I feel my knowledge of test writing in unit/test is insufficient.
